## Project Title  

**Ahaar**

## Project Description    

**Ahaar** is an intelligent food analyzer and nutritional guide designed to help people make healthier food choices in real time. Utilizing advanced AI models, Ahaar recognizes various food items through a camera and provides detailed insights on their nutritional content, health benefits, and potential risks. If a detected food item is deemed unhealthy, Ahaar suggests healthier alternatives, guiding users toward smarter, balanced choices. With its user-friendly interface and focus on daily nutrition tracking, Ahaar empowers users to better understand and improve their dietary habits, promoting a healthier lifestyle.

## Inspiration Behind the Project  

The inspiration for Ahaar comes from the urgent need to address the growing issue of diet-related health concerns, particularly in India. Millions face health problems like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease due to poor dietary choices, yet thereâ€™s limited technology available to support informed food decisions. Our goal was to create a solution that provides real-time nutritional guidance, enabling users to understand the impact of their food and make healthier lifestyle choices. Ahaar bridges this gap by offering accessible nutritional information that can improve users' long-term health and well-being.
